# 🧩 Sudoku Solver (Unity)

A **2D Sudoku solver built with Unity**, focused on algorithmic problem-solving and game-development practice.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

This is a **personal learning project** with the following objectives:

1. **Revisit classic backtracking algorithms**
   - Implement a correct and complete Sudoku solver
   - Understand recursion, backtracking, and failure cases

2. **Explore faster alternatives to brute-force backtracking**
   - Constraint propagation
   - Heuristics such as MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)
   - Early impossibility detection

3. **Improve Unity development skills**, including:
   - Script architecture and clean code
   - Prefabs and reusable components
   - UI feedback (loading / solving state)
   - Particle effects and visual polish

---

## ✨ Features

- Interactive Sudoku grid
- Backtracking solver (baseline)
- Optimized solver with heuristics
- Detection of impossible Sudoku configurations
- Visual feedback while solving (non-blocking coroutines)
- Clean separation between game logic and solver logic

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Unity 2D**
- **C#**
- Coroutine-based execution (frame-safe solving)

---

## 🚧 Status

This project can **evolve** as new algorithms and optimizations are explored.

---

## 📌 Notes

This project prioritizes **learning and experimentation** over perfect performance.  
The solver is intentionally written step-by-step to better understand algorithmic behavior rather than relying on prebuilt libraries.
